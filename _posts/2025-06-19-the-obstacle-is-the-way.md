# 0.0 Context setting
It's coming up to the end of June 2025, and my birthday is rapidly approaching. It's about 11.30pm on Wednesday, 20 November, 2024. In a recent Level Up newsletter by Pat Kua, there was a link to a blog post by Mike Fisher about writing and I thought to myself "That seems like a great idea, I should try it", and then I remembered this blog that I started over a year ago and then abandoned for reasons. So here we are again.

Once again, the weather this year stayed warm for a long time (we've had some 20 degree+ days even in this month), but the nights and mornings are getting cold and I have finally broken out the long-sleeves, jumpers and assorted winter wear.

I was half-heartedly watching Crisis: Special Security Squad[<sup>3</sup>](#fn-3){:.fnref #fnref-3} with Japanese subtitles on (since that's all the series has available on Netflix), understanding about 60% and wondering how I still at Japanese after living here for nine years (my anniversary passed on October 31st).

On a different note, having to add hyperlinks at the bottom of a blog post worked for this format as a newsletter delivered to someone's inbox, but for writing that is only going to be on the internet it's a pain in the arse and so that is getting ditched right now.
