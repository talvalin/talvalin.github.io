This is a blog about engineering management from the perspective of someone who isn't really an actual Engineering Manager.
To give you some context, I spent about ten years working in Technical Support in a mostly customer-facing role. 
Now I find myself managing a team of Technical Support _Engineers_ who sit in between a customer-facing support team and the rest of the Engineering department, and having to learn about things like scrum, agile, and other things that were completely alien to me only a year ago.
